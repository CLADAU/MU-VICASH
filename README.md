# MufaLeaf: multi faceted data exploration in the browser

![MufaLeaf Preview](/assets/img/Culture_Viz11small.png?raw=true "MufaLeaf Preview")

An experiment in enabling application level data filtering and reactive update of multiple widgets including a Leaflet Map and a amCharts graph.

- Load data from Google Sheets (15k+ records)
- Display as multiple clustered layers on the map, single markers have dynamically assigned font-awesome icons
- Filter by data facets
- Filter by time interval
- Display TreeMap data structure analysis

Code is VERY FAR from being polished and perfect, please feel encouraged to make it better and drop a PR.
